      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">Who I am</h2>

      <p>
        My name's Alessandro Desantis (<em>“da-sun-tees”</em> is how you'd spell it) and I am a
        Ruby developer based in Rome. That's where the Colosseum is, not
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_(New_York)">the city in New York state.</a> (And
        before you even ask: yes, people have made that mistake.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Software development is a family thing here: my uncle and father encouraged me to take it
        on when I was just nine, which means I've been at this for almost ten years now. I can
        honestly say that I have enjoyed and continue to enjoy every single second of it: writing
        software is not a mere assembly line for me—it's a craft. It requires dedication and skill
        to create a polished, functional product that makes people happy. Things shouldn't <em>just
        work.</em> They should be beautiful. I thrive when the people's lives are simplified or
        improved thanks to my work.
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">What I do</h2>

      <p>
        Right now, I am working as a freelancer at <a href="https://gigster.com">Gigster</a>, where
        I get to work on a bazillion different projects daily. Gigster is awesome because I am free
        to work on projects where I can really make an impact. For a concise (I promise!) list of
        stuff that I have worked and am working on here, you should check out
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-desantis-08a7a5105">my LinkedIn profile.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with my family and some incredibly talented network engineers, I'm also rocking it
        with <a href="http://www.interconn.it">InterConn</a>, a wireless ISP whose mission is to
        bring fast, affordable internet connectivity to those left behind by the big players in the
        field. I feel honored to be able to serve so many people and gift them with what the rest of
        us take for granted. InterConn is an amazing opportunity of keeping in touch with the human
        aspect of my job.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the way, everyone's on support at InterConn. Does that remind you of
        <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3676-everyone-on-support">someone?</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">What else I do</h2>

      <p>
        Speaking of non-profitable activities, this is just some of the stuff I do <em>when no
        one's watching</em>:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>I take photos.</strong> <a href="https://500px.com/@alessandro1997">You should
          check them out.</a> Some people say I'm fairly decent.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>I listen to synth pop.</strong> Is that still a thing? It is for me. Depeche
          Mode, here I come!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>I write code.</strong> When I'm not writing code for a living, I write code for
          fun. <a href="https://github.com/alessandro1997">Have a look.</a>
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>I write articles.</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@alessandro1997">I'm on
          Medium</a>, <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com">you're on Medium</a>, everyone's on
          Medium!
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>I write books.</strong> Well, one book, precisely. It's entitled <em>“APIs on
          Rails” </em> or something.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>I travel.</strong> Chicago's on my list, too. Perhaps you know someone
          who can help? <img src="img/eye-roll.png" class="emoji">
        </li>
      </ul>
