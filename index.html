      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">Who I am</h2>

      <p>
        My name's Alessandro Desantis (<em>“da-sun-tees”</em> is how you'd spell it) and I am a
        Ruby developer based in Rome. That's where the Colosseum is, not
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rome_(New_York)">the city in New York state.</a> (And
        before you even ask: yes, people have made that mistake.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Software development is a family thing here: my uncle and father encouraged me to take it
        on <strong>when I was only nine,</strong> which means I've been at this for almost ten years
        now. I can honestly say that I have enjoyed and continue to enjoy every single second of it:
        <strong>writing software is not a mere assembly line for me—it's a craft.</strong> It
        requires dedication and skill to create a polished, functional product that makes people
        happy. Things shouldn't <em>just work.</em> They should be beautiful. <strong>I thrive when
        the people's lives are simplified or improved thanks to my work.</strong>
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">What I do</h2>

      <p>
        Right now, I am working as a freelancer at <a href="https://gigster.com">Gigster</a>, where
        I get to work on a bazillion different projects daily. Gigster is awesome because I am free
        to work on projects where I can really make an impact. For a concise (I promise!) list of
        stuff that I have worked and am working on here, you should check out
        <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/alessandro-desantis-08a7a5105">my LinkedIn profile.</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Together with my family and some incredibly talented network engineers, I'm also rocking it
        with <a href="http://www.interconn.it">InterConn</a>, a wireless ISP whose mission is to
        bring fast, affordable internet connectivity to those left behind by the big players in the
        field. I feel honored to be able to serve so many people and gift them with what the rest of
        us take for granted. InterConn is an amazing opportunity of keeping in touch with the human
        aspect of my job.
      </p>

      <p>
        By the way, <strong>everyone's on support at InterConn.</strong> Does that remind you of
        <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3676-everyone-on-support">anybody?</a>
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">What else I do</h2>

      <p>
        Speaking of non-profitable activities, this is just some of the stuff I do <em>when no
        one's watching:</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>I take photos.</strong> <a href="https://500px.com/@alessandro1997">You should
            check them out.</a> Some people say I'm fairly decent.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>I listen to synthpop.</strong> Is that still a thing? It is for me. Depeche
            Mode, here I come!
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>I write code.</strong> When I'm not writing code for a living, I write code for
            fun. <a href="https://github.com/alessandro1997">Have a look.</a>
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>I write articles.</strong> <a href="https://medium.com/@alessandro1997">I'm on
            Medium</a>, <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com">you're on Medium</a>, everyone's on
            Medium!
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>I write books.</strong> Well, one book, precisely. It's entitled <em>“APIs on
            Rails” </em> or something.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>I travel.</strong> Chicago's on my list, too. Perhaps you know someone
            who can help? <img src="img/eye-roll.png" class="emoji">
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>I binge-watch TV series.</strong> No spoilers, guys. I mean it. No. Spoilers.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h2 class="section-title typl8-delta">Why I want to join</h2>

      <p>I'm looking to join you, and that's for a couple of reasons.</p>

      <p>
        First of all, <strong>you have revolutionized the way I write software.</strong> I know, I
        know: Rails is not Ruby. Except it is: without Rails, I would have never known about Ruby.
        Without Ruby, I would have never discovered that package managers are a thing. I mean, guys,
        I used to write PHP. We had <a href="http://pear.php.net/">PEAR</a>. Then we had Symfony and
        Composer and all of that stuff but, at the end of the day, we were <em>still</em> writing
        PHP, with all its procedural quirks. <strong>Ruby was magic to me,</strong> so much so that
        I struggled to understand it for the first days, but when I got it... <em>oh boy!</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, I'm not a Rails fanboy. <strong>There are many things which I don't like about
        Rails.</strong> I don't agree with everything you guys say—in fact, I strongly disagree with
        some of it, which is one of the reasons you could use me. I've been involved in
        <a href="https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer">open-source projects</a> that deviate
        from the Rails way of doing things. I'm even the author of <a href="https://github.com/pragmarb">such
        a set of tools</a> (I'd love to hear your thoughts on Pragma, BTW). <strong>I have strong
        opinions, weakly held.</strong> I will speak up when I think something can be done better
        and shut up when you show me that I'm wrong. That brings me to the second reason I'm eager
        to work at Basecamp.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>I love your culture.</strong> You speak about
        <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228">Majestic
        Monoliths</a> at a time where everybody and their dog seem to be using microservices, for
        everything, all the time. You create <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks-ios">tools</a>
        that let a single full-stack developer write a mobile app with Good Enough performance,
        while mobile developers cry at the idea of non-native animations. When others sell their
        products with pretty UIs and useless whistles, <strong>you sell it with a 275-words letter
        from your CEO</strong> and well-polished features that your customers actually need.
        <strong>You focus on people, not software.</strong> You know that
        <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/basecamp-3-work-can-wait-4adfb285c84b#.351ptz9j8">Work
        Can Wait</a> because you know that, ultimately, our only goal is to live awesome lives.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Let's make 2017 the most awesome summer yet, Basecamp.</strong> I'm ready.</p>
